        </blockquote>
        <h1 id="first-of-15-mins-class">First of 15 Mins class</h1>
        <p>At the beginning of every class the <strong>do now</strong> is to write your goal for today and be prepared to share it with the class if called on.</p>
        <p>Your goal should be clear, specific, and something you can finish during our class. It could be about a project you’re already working on or a new challenge we just announced.</p>
        <p><strong>Here’s an example of a good goal:</strong> “Today, I want to make my character change its costume when it’s clicked and start moving around the screen.”</p>
        <p>This goal is clear, specific, and something you can finish today. It gives you a clear plan for what to do next and helps you focus on what’s important.</p>
        <p>If you’re not sure what you were working on or you’re starting something new, don’t worry! Let a teacher know, and we’ll help you figure out a good goal. You can also think about which of our challenges sounds most interesting to you.</p>
        <p>Once you’ve set your goal, open your laptops, and let’s get started! You’re ready to take off!</p>
        <h1 id="instructions-after-your-do-now">Instructions After Your “Do Now”</h1>
        <p>After you finish your “Do Now,” please log in to the Scratch and LaunchPad websites. If you haven’t done so yet, you may need to create an account using your student email.</p>
        <p>Once logged in, you can either continue working on a project or start a new one on the LaunchPad website. You’re welcome to work in teams and talk aloud as you collaborate.</p>
        <p>If you get stuck, first try to solve the problem on your own. If you still can’t figure it out, here’s what I want you to do:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <p>Write a quick bug report in your notebook or on your computer. A good bug report should include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Goal - What you were trying to do</strong>: Describe what you were working on when the problem happened.</li>
        <li><strong>Issue - What went wrong</strong>: Explain exactly what’s not working as expected.</li>
        <li><strong>Attempts - What you’ve already tried</strong>: List the steps you’ve taken to fix the problem.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>After writing your bug report, call me over. Be ready to clearly explain the problem using your bug report, so we can work together to solve it.</p>
        </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Use this template to submit your bug report to me</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Example:<br/>
        <strong>Goal</strong>: I was trying to make my character change its costume when it’s clicked.</p>
        <p><strong>Issue</strong>: The costume isn’t changing, even though I added the code for it.</p>
        <p><strong>Attempts</strong>: I checked my code to make sure it’s correct, and I tried reloading the project, but it’s still not working.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This way, you’ll get better at solving problems on your own and learn how to communicate clearly when you need help.</p>
        <h1 id="last-15-mins-of-class">Last 15 Mins of class</h1>

        <p>Submit Class Summaries<br/>
        Key specific things to document include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>What project each of your students is working on and in what language/tool</li>
        <li>Student enjoyment, enthusiasm, mood, attitude, etc.</li>
        <li>Any issues you encountered with student misbehavior, focus, or enthusiasm</li>
        <li>Any issues you had with your teaching environment, logistics, etc.</li>
        <li>Any issues between you and your co-teacher(s)</li>
        <li>Any issues you would like advice on or need help with<br/>
        If there is an issue that you feel needs immediate attention, please contact your manager right away, especially as it relates to student safety.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If there is a behavioral issue that has persisted beyond one or two classes, please bring this to your manager’s attention in addition to filling out your evaluation form.</p>
        <p>Any class where the structure breaks down - for example, if you have to skip a part or students do not cooperate - make sure to send a report with as much detail as possible to your supervisor.</p>
        <p>If you have difficulty implementing this structure due to any logistical reasons related to the space where you are teaching, send a report to your supervisor about the issue and we will help!</p>

        How Well Did Class Go Today? 9</p>
        <p>Notes:</p>
        <p>Busy class today! I was so impressed with how focused they were while they worked.</p>
        <p>Emily made great progress on her game, Potato Wizard! Her storylines are so creative. Jake worked on Poetry Slam and though I didn’t see a ton of progress, he did seem very focused and diligent. Ryan finished Apple Catcher, though with a limited understanding of multiplication, it was hard to get him to use an operator to connect the level to the change in y position. Instead he coded a new change of y for each level, which works. He was very proud of himself!</p>
        <p>Jeff was still a bit antsy, but he made progress on his latest project. Kayla did good work on her Dirt Friend game but had to leave early. She made some breakthroughs in this class in understanding that code needs to go in a specific order to work correctly.</p>
        <p>I know Luke was working on Flappy Flop, but I didn’t spend any time with him, since Friendo and he have a very good rapport. It was Juno’s last class, she worked on the maze game. She’s very good at coding, but I don’t think she particularly likes it. Ben did great work, was running into some complex issues regarding the shield power up in Super Boss Face Off. He did a great job talking through the layers of the issue, and then drawing a concept map to help him understand which pieces needed to happen first.</p>
        <p>Group Activity - about half the kids opted to keep coding or read, and about half played Set. It went well, and I’m gonna separate the blended decks to help keep us from extra issues.</p>
        <p>Does the Class Need More Teachers? No</p>
        <p>Would You Like Further Advice or Feedback? No</p>
        <h1 id="progress-reports">Progress Reports</h1>
        <p>When filling out a progress report:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <p>First, discuss how the student benefited themselves in the following areas: programming knowledge, logic skills, research ability, building friendships, math knowledge, and changing the world big and small.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Add to that, how the student benefited others in the following areas: assistance with projects, helping inspire other students, helping build a fun atmosphere, helping create a safe environment, following teacher suggestions and instructions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Next, add what is a growth zone for the student and where they can improve, as a programmer, a learner, and a member of their classroom.</p>
        <p>Please keep the following in mind as your write your progress notes:</p>
        </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>Be specific in the feedback. General statements like “Miles is great/a great coder,” aren’t received with much enthusiasm.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Know that many of our parents don’t understand what coding is, what different programming languages mean, or what their kids are doing in class. Keep things as simple as possible as far as technical terms and provide helpful context when possible.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Many parents want to know “what’s next”, and how we measure progress, so the more detail we can provide as far as each student’s journey, and what they’re working towards, the better.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Each student gets one progress note, so feel free to decide how best to divide the labor with the other teachers you are working with.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It’s possible that a progress report will be returned to you with notes on how to improve it. If you have any questions about writing these, feel free to reach out at any time.</p>
        <p>Example</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Here’s an example we created to show you something we think works well:</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Katie comes to class with a lot of energy, and launches into taking on our Scratch “untutorials” from the first minutes of class. When she reaches challenging points (like figuring out how to move things in the four directions), she tries to help other students, but is responsive when we guide her back. Once she overcomes a challenge she is working on (like when she figured out how to stop her game and put up a “Game Over” screen in her Apple Catcher game when the timer hit zero), she is focused and happy. We can always count on her to be up for the challenges we present, and she is helpful and follows teacher directions and helps inspire other students. We’d like to see her try to complete all of the optional challenges and steps in the projects she does, and we would like to see her move on from Level 2 Scratch projects to Level 3 Scratch projects very soon. By the end of the semester, we hope she’ll try WoofJS (our type-coding JavaScript learning tool). She also should learn not to be afraid of things that may not be understood immediately. Programming is complex and takes time to learn.”</p>
